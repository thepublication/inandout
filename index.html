  <h1>Archived In/Out Lists</h1>
  
  <p>The In/Out list recognizes its origins in the trendiness of trend reporting ca. spring 2015. Acknowledgements for concept creation go to N. Serhan and M. Schulman.<br /> <br />
    The lists are not prescriptions but observations and predictions. While we would all like to believe that we are exempt from living in a society, trends are unstoppable forces. It is not a sign of weakness to succumb to them! Instead, the lists recognize that these cultural waves exist and shift. The format and style of each list imitate their original appearance to further showcase trends. </p>
