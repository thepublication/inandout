  <h1>Archived In/Out Lists</h1>
  
  <p>The In/Out list recognizes its origins in the trendiness of trend reporting ca. spring 2015. Acknowledgements from the creators go to N. Serhan and D. Djaya.<br />
    The lists are not prescriptions but observations and predictions. While we would all like to believe that we are exempt from living in a society, trends are unstoppable forces. It is not a sign of weakness to succumb to them! Instead, the lists recognize that these cultural waves exist and shift. </p>
